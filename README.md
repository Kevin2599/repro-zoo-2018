### Running the notebooks

If you have Python, you can run the notebooks locally. Make a new environment containing the packages in `environment.yml` and you should be able to run most of them. (One or two might have other dependencies, e.g. Madagascar).

Alternatively, clone the repo to your [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) account to use that platform. Or use the button below to launch the repo in My Binder to run the notebooks in your browser right now:
